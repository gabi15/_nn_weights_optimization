# _nn_weights_optimization

- Project for subject Computional intelligence methods.
- Main purpose of the project was to develop and examine algorithm to optimize weights of MLP neural network using neture inspired technique.
- We based on this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-neural-networks-optimization-using-genetic-algorithm-with-python-1fe8ed17733e)
in which GA is used, we decided to implement PSO algorithm.
- if you want to run pso algorithm - run pso_main
  * to adjust parameters change test_parameters variable
  * branch master contains pso using inertia weight
  * branch constriction_with_inertia contains pso using iertia weight and constriction (which gives better results)
- if you want to run ga algorithm - run genetic_main
